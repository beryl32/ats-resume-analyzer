🧠 How It Works

1. The user uploads a PDF resume.

2. The app converts the first page to an image using pdf2image.

3. The image is encoded to Base64 and sent along with a job description to Google Gemini.

4. Gemini analyzes the resume:

5. Evaluates it

6. Matches it against job description

7. Suggests improvements

8. The user can download a professionally rewritten resume as a PDF.



🔒 Important Notes

 Only the first page of the PDF is currently analyzed.

 The app requires Poppler for PDF-to-image conversion (on Windows).
